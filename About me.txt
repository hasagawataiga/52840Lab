    I am Vietnamese - a beautiful country - with a lot of nice places to visit (if you planned to travel and have no choice yet, please give Vietnam a chance).
Trust me, Vietnam deserved it. After seeing Vietnam by yourself, you will see that Vietnam is not just famous for war (with America if you ask).

I studied about Mechanical engineering in Vietnam. In this case, you can call me a newbie in IT industry.
It is quite confused about the my future career while there are so many paths (mobile, embeded, web,..)
I wondered whether this field or that field is suitable to me. 
In this case, I am trying to dive into each field to have a reality observation.
Now, I am working for a team in Unity project as intern.
I am interested in Cybersecurity or Data security, too.
On other hand, I have courses about web technologies for this semester.

I planned to give me 1 year to demonstrate which path I will choose to be my main career.
I have learned about:
    Java
    C#
    C++
    Python
    Algorithm
    Structure & Complexity
    OOP
    Unity
    HTML
By the way, I am studied about CSS and JS in order to create my own website or article blog.
And Linux (Kali) for cybersecurity.

I know that stuying a lot of things and do not focus on anything is not a good idea.
 But I have no choice because Every single path is not familiar to me (I have to study and work to know what is reasonable)
If you have suggestions or advices, please help me. I am in a "chaos-orientation".
